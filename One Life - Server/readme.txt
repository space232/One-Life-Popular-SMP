'One Life - Popular SMP' Server v4.1
> This only supports the corresponding 'One Life - Popular SMP' modpack version.

I've been receiving loads of messages recently regarding the modpack.
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAY THE MINECRAFT MODPACK, DOWNLOAD IT THROUGH TECHNIC LAUNCHER.

This is the SERVER PACK, which is used to HOST games. NOT to play games.

(F)requently (A)sked (Q)uestions:

Q: How do I install this? Please help!
A: You should only be using this if you know what you are doing. Regardless, we do provide basic support for
setting this up on our discord/over email. 
https://lunarcube.net/discord or support@lunarcube.net

Q: How do I get more lives? / How can I turn off Hardcore?
A: Open the server.properties file in Notepad and turn "hardcore=true" to "hardcore=false"

Q: I am still regenerating health. Bug?
A: We cannot provide a way to integrate commands to be run on startup, this would pose a very serious
   security issue, but also pose a issue with trust & safety.
   When your server is finished launching, please copy and paste the following into your terminal:
   /gamerule naturalRegeneration false

Q: How do I adjust the difficulty?
A: Open the server.properties file in Notepad and change the "difficulty=3" as follows:
	0 = PEACEFUL (no hostile mobs will spawn)
	1 = EASY
	2 = NORMAL
	3 = HARD
